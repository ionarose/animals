## Rent a fish

<a href= "https://rent-a-fish.vercel.app/" targed="_blank" >Visit the live demo</a>

Rent a fish for any occasion. Competative weekly rates, and the healthiest, happiest fish on the market - fish welfare is our highest priority. Need a date for your graduation? We recommend an atlantic spiny dogfish to really turn heads. Coming up short on your weedding guestlist? Why not employ the services of a school of northern anchovies?

All our fish are trained in etiquite from over 60 different cultures.

I built this app as a practical exploration into Material UI. There are no CSS files and minimal inline styling. The shopping cart feature is currently demonstrative only, and does not persist.
